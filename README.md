## Transparent 1x1 Pixel Graphic

> The aim of hosting a transparent 1x1 pixel graphic in this GitHub repository  is to provide a permanently available, [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) ready, publicly accessible  online resource  that does not throw any [SOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)/cross-origin request errors when being requested directly.

> I use it in different web apps/PWAs (client- and/or server side JavaScript/TypeScript) to be able to reliably monitor the status of the network connection (online/offline). I mostly use it with [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) to adept the apps behaviour in case of a network connection status change.
